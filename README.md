# Intro to ML project 2
## Backpropegation by hand
This assignment focuses on building machine learning models to predict the century in which a music piece was released. It utilizes the YearPredictionMSD dataset, derived from the Million Song Dataset. The task involves back propegation by hand , data preprocessing, training various models, and evaluating their performance in classifying music by its release period
